/*For fun*/

//Separate background into squares (probably squares not just rectangles)
//Test out big vs small, which one is less distracting
//If in general squares are too distracting, do some kind of blurred image with sampled colors

//For each square get random pixel from picture and use its color

//So need to get canvas data (from canvas id so should be fine getting context from index)

//To get random number: Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
